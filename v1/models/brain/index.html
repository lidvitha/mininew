              The brain is an incredibly complex organ responsible for various
              functions including cognition, emotion, memory, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
              It consists of billions of neurons interconnected through
              synapses, forming intricate neural networks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Studying the brain helps us understand human behavior, perception,
              and consciousness, as well as neurological disorders.
